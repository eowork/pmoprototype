# PMO CORE — Coordinated restore script (DB + uploads from one backup set)
# Usage: bash /mnt/d/Programming/pmo-dash/restore.sh <backup-timestamp>
# Example: bash restore.sh 20260630_143000
#
# SAFETY: NEVER runs "docker compose down -v". Restores into the running
# postgres container via pg_restore and uploads via docker cp.
# The stack must be running before restore.
#
# WARNING: This REPLACES all current database data and upload files.
# It is intended for disaster recovery, not incremental updates.
